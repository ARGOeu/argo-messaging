# Communication Channels

There are two ways you can initiate communication with the team behind the
Argo Messaging Service.

1) If you are coming through EOSC, you should use the
official [EOSC Helpdesk portal.](https://eosc-helpdesk.eosc-portal.eu/#login)
2) Otherwise you can reach out through **_argo at grnet.gr_**
