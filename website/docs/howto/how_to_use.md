## Ideas
Some ideas about how to use the service 
 - Balancing workloads in network clusters: For example, a large queue of tasks can be efficiently distributed among multiple workers (e.g. Fedcloud instances).
 - Implementing asynchronous workflows: For example, an order processing application can place an order on a topic, from which it can be processed by one or more workers.
 - Publishing of monitoring results: Monitoring Engines can push monitoring results through the ARGO Monitoring Service
 - Publishing of accounting data: Act as the transport layer for the secure exchange of accounting information
 - Log aggregation: Log aggregation from different services in your infrastructure

    - Small description of the integration - use of Messaging service (pull, push option)
    - An email to associate the new Messaging user 
    - The messaging team will create an new project/topic/subscription to the devel infrastructure for testing.  
 - The messaging team will close the ticket and will respond to the user email by providing 
    - User token 
    - Service endpoint
    - URL to the detailed documentation and some  examples ready to use
 - When the user is ready we will apply the appropriate configuration to the production infrastructure
