title: Receiving messages using Push
---

Subscribers can read messages from named-channels called Subscriptions.  Each subscription can belong to a single topic. A topic though can have multiple subscriptions. 
If you are a subscriber and you want to receive messages published to a topic, the idea is that you should create a subscription to that topic. 
The subscription is the connection of the topic to a specific application, and its fuction is to receive and process messages published to the topic. 
Only messages published to the topic after the subscription is created are available to subscriber applications. 

AMS supports both push and pull message delivery. In push delivery, the Messaging Service initiates requests to your subscriber application to deliver messages. 
In pull delivery, your subscription application initiates requests to the Pub/Sub server to retrieve messages.

**Push subscriptions**
In a push subscription, the push server sends a request to the subscriber application, at a preconfigured endpoint. The subscriber's HTTP response serves as an implicit acknowledgement: a success response indicates that the message has been successfully processed and the Pub/Sub system can delete it from the subscription; a non-success response indicates that the Pub/Sub server should resend it (implicit "nack"). To ensure that subscribers can handle the message flow, the Pub/Sub dynamically adjusts the flow of requests and uses an algorithm to rate-limit retries. The push server(s) are an optional set of worker-machines that are needed when the AMS wants to support push enabled subscriptions. It allows to decouple the push functionality from AMS api nodes They perform the push functionality for the messages of a push enabled subscription (consume->deliverâ†’ack)/ Provide a gRPC interface in order to communicate with their api Provide subscription runtime status
