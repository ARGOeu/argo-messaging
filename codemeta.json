  "description": "The ARGO Messaging Service is a Publish/Subscribe Service, which implements the Google PubSub protocol. Instead of focusing on a single Messaging API specification for handling the logic of publishing/subscribing to the broker network the API focuses on creating nodes of Publishers and Subscribers as a Service. It provides an HTTP API that enables Users/Systems to implement message oriented services using the Publish/Subscribe Model over plain HTTP. In the Publish/Subscribe paradigm, Publishers are users/systems that can send messages to named-channels called Topics. Subscribers are users/systems that create Subscriptions to specific topics and receive messages.",
